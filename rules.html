        <p class="green"><strong>Appealing</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe you have been falsely muted or banned, please run the command '/msg Emmett1027 (The reason why you got banned) (duration of the ban) (Who banned you) (Why you think the ban was false)' in minehut, or message me; @Emmett1027 in github, with the same thing but with your username in Minecraft in the last part.</p>

        <p><strong>Chat Rules</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Please be respectful, and at least try restrain to words that aren't curses. Filter triggering 30 times in 1 hour when it's obviously a bad word will result in a <strong>10 minute mute.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Please do not be racist, please do not accuse somebody of racism if they defeat you somehow <strong>[1H MUTE]</strong>, and please do not try to bypass the filter.</p>
        <p>If you bypass the filter, it will result into a 1 hour ban.</p>

        <br>
        <p><strong>Game Rules</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1. </strong>Please do not use any unfair modification that gives you an avantage over other players that you wouldn't have without it. <strong>If you believe you should be able to use it, please ask an admin or Emmett1027 himself.</strong> First offense will result into a 1 day ban, 2nd will result in a 10 day ban, 3rd will result into a 30 day ban, and 4th will result into a permanent ban.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2. </strong>If you are an exploiter, and want to find exploits & all that good stuff, you can. You won't be banned for trying to find an exploit. <strong> Although, if you abuse it without telling a developer or the owner,</strong> that will result in a <em><strong>5 day ban.</strong></em> If you tell a developer or staff or owner, you will be rewared, and you will be able to abuse the exploit or bug as much as you can without getting banned until a developer patches it.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><strong>General Rules</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1. </strong>Please do not annoy staff. It's rude, and if you do; you will get a mute for 10 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2. </strong>If you have an argument with a staff and they are saying they will ban you because you broke the rules, but you think you didn't. Please tell a red ranked staff to decide this. If there are none on, just wait for them to log on.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Sorry for any inconviences in the rules or in appealing, if you have a suggestion, please suggest it in /suggest (suggestion) or message Emmett1027 about it.</em></p>
